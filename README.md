README.md - Assignment #4: Frogger, Part 2
==========================================

IMPLEMENTED ASPECTS (BASIC): Game loads immediately; Frogger moves and loses a life when it touches the water or gets hit by a vehicle; vehicles and logs are animated; basic scoring is in place

IMPLEMENTED ASPECTS (ADDITIONAL): Timer; dead frog image is displayed when Frogger dies; fly; level progression (speed of vehicles and logs increases)

COLLABORATORS: Talked to Ann, Rui, and a couple others in Halligan (plus Ming!)

TIME SPENT: ~10 hours
